# ACN Skill

## Overview

This Skill directs the workflow of a tool chain to connect a new embodied agent into a core network subnet. Follow the defined process to output the specific **Tool Name** and **Fill in Parameters**. Ensure all arguments are instantiated based on the context provided.

## Tool Inventory


## Workflow

Follow the pseudo-code logic below and fill in parameters for each tool to execute tasks.
 
    # Step 1: Subscription Status Check
    CALL "Subscription_tool"

    # Step 2: Create/Update Subnet Context
    CALL "Create_Or_Update_Subnet_Context_tool"

    # Step 3: Issue Access Token
    CALL "Issue_Access_Token_tool"
            
    # Step 4: Token Validation
    CALL "Validate_Access_Token_tool"

    # Step 5: Establish PDU Session
    CALL "Create_Subnet_PDUSession_tool"
    
    OUTPUT "DONE"


## Critical Rules

- Do not skip any step.
- All parameters marked as required must be provided. 
- When filling parameters, ensure values for identical keys remain consistent across all steps.
- For tools in the sequence (e.g., if Tool A is followed by Tool B), ensure that **all identical keys** shared between them maintain the exact same values.
- If any tool returns **false** or fails to execute, you must output "ABORT" and exit the workflow.


## Output Format

Subscription_tool(ue_id="SUCI_12345", service_type="SubnetAccess", "is_subscribed"="True")
...
